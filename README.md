## :man: Author

  

I consider myself a frontend craftsman. The client-side to me is what keeps the user on the platform longer, being the first point of contact. This drives me to aim for pixel-perfect implementation of UI designs centered on a good user experience. <br />
I have always been inquisitive and this has driven me to acquire skills with which I can effect positive changes. In a bid to harness this I partook in the HNG (Hotels.ng) internship of which I was a finalist.here: [HNGinternship](https://hngi7.hng.tech/index)
